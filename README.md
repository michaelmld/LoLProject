# LoLProject

To get the project setup

1) install node https://nodejs.org/en/download/  
2) I use webstorm you can use sublime or w/e for your IDE  
3) run the project with nodemon ./bin/www  - nodemon makes it so you dont have to refresh the server each time you make a change and the executable is www  
4) go to localhost:8000 to test out a random page with a list of champions from LoL  
5) localhost:8000/form is just a test form that we will use later to do stuff, if you submit the form notice how the server knows what you submitted.
